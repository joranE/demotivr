Just give up.
It's not worth it, go back to bed.

This code is written by an idiot, full of errors, signifying nothing. - W. Shakespeare
What if this is all there is?
Is this really how you want to spend your short, brutal existence?
If you delete all your code, it will run just fine!
Have you tried fixing the error by throwing your computer out the window?
It was probably going to give you the wrong result anyway.
Once you get this code running, your life will still have no meaning.
It's always worse than it seems.
The only thing standing between you and total happiness is that happiness is an illusion.
Remember, your frustration, like everything else, doesn't exist.
The only thing worse than broken code is code that works but no one cares about.
No one cares about this code. They're just pretending.
Is your soul as broken as this code?
Remember, this code is doing *precisely* what you told it to.
Life sucks, then you die.
You are never more alone than when you are debugging.

Death comes to us all; we can only choose how to face it when it comes. - Robert Jordan
Time doesn't heal all wounds, or fix all bugs.
To perceive is to suffer. - Aristotle
Just starting typing random shit; that might actually work better.
You still haven't fixed it?
Still not working, huh?
